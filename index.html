    <h3 id="rules-title">Rules</h3>
    <p id="rules">
      <span>1- Simon is a memory-based electronic game that tests your ability to recall sequences of colors and sounds.</span>
      <span>2- The game consists of four colored buttons – red, blue, green, and yellow – each associated with a unique tone.</span>
      <span>3- Simon generates a random sequence that players must replicate by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order.</span>
      <span>4- The difficulty increases with each successful round, challenging players to remember and repeat longer and more complex patterns.</span>
